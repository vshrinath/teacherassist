# Terms of Use & Disclaimer

**TeacherAssist** is an AI-powered educational aid designed to support lesson planning, visual aid creation, and classroom engagement. By using this platform, you acknowledge and agree to the following terms:

### 1. The Nature of AI & Prompt Engineering
This platform utilizes "System Prompt Engineering" to guide Google's Gemini models. While these models are highly capable, AI is an emerging and non-deterministic technology. It does not pull from a fixed database; it generates responses based on complex patterns. Consequently, results may vary and are not guaranteed to be 100% accurate regarding factual data, calculations, or pedagogical theory.

### 2. Safety & Guardrails
We have implemented multi-layered safety guardrails specifically designed for the Indian classroom context (including zero-bias protocols for religion, politics, and social hierarchies). However, no AI system can guarantee the absolute absence of unforeseen elements, unintended biases, or inappropriate content. 

### 3. Professional Responsibility (Human-in-the-Loop)
**TeacherAssist is a supplement, not a substitute.**
The final authority in the classroom is the Teacher. It is your professional responsibility to:
- **Review and Verify**: Always double-check AI-generated facts, names, and activities before presenting them to students.
- **Contextualize**: Adjust the AI's suggestions to fit the specific emotional and academic needs of your unique classroom environment.
- **Safety Check**: Ensure all suggested physical activities or materials are safe for your students.

### 4. Limitation of Liability
The creators and contributors of TeacherAssist take no responsibility for the accuracy or consequences of the AI-generated outputs. Use of this tool is at the teacher's own risk. We are not liable for any errors, omissions, or any actions taken based on the information provided by the Gems.
