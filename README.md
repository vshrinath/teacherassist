# TeacherAssist

TeacherAssist is a powerful, yet ultra-simple AI tool designed to help teachers explain complex concepts to students in Grade 1-10. It is specifically built for teachers working in resource-constrained environments where students may be developing English fluency and respond best to concrete, local, and relatable examples.

## Who is it for?

- **Teachers**: Especially those teaching Math, Science, Social Studies, and EVS in Grade 1-10.
- **School Administrators**: Who want to provide their teaching staff with high-quality, pre-configured AI teaching tools (Gemini Gems).
- **Localized Education**: Ideal for boards like **Karnataka State**, **CBSE**, **ICSE**, and **IGCSE** where aligning with local cultural context is critical.

## What does it help with?

TeacherAssist bridges the gap between abstract textbook definitions and the child's daily reality. It helps by:

- **Simplifying Explanations**: Converts complex topics into short, simple sentences and everyday analogies (e.g., using rice, chapati, or a school bus to explain science/math).
- **Universal Grade-Level Gems**: One single tool per grade that can handle any subject (Math, Science, Social Studies) with subject-specific pedagogical "flavors."
- **Interactive Commands**:
    - `/101`: Generates a "first-time" simple explanation.
    - `/activities`: Suggests low-cost, hands-on classroom games and physical movement.
    - `/youtube`: Provides specific search strings for visual animations and demonstrations.
    - `/quiz`: Creates context-aware, 10-question quizzes with an answer key.
- **Safe Classroom Guardrails**: Strictly ensures no religious, political, or social bias, and maintains absolute age-appropriateness and inclusivity.
- **One-Click Sharing**: Allows teachers to easily share Grade-level tools via WhatsApp for instant access.

## How it Works

1. **Admin Panel**: Administrators generate a "Universal Prompt" for a specific Grade and Board.
2. **Gemini Integration**: The prompt is used to create a "Gem" in Google Gemini, where grade-specific textbooks are uploaded as knowledge.
3. **Teacher Portal**: Teachers visit the portal, select their Grade, and instantly launch their custom AI assistant.
