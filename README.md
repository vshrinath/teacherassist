# TeacherAssist

TeacherAssist is a powerful, yet ultra-simple AI tool designed to help teachers explain complex concepts to students in Grade 1-10. It is specifically built for teachers working in resource-constrained environments where students may be developing English fluency and respond best to concrete, local, and relatable examples.

## Who is it for?

- **Teachers**: Especially those teaching Math, Science, Social Studies, and EVS in Grade 1-10.
- **School Administrators**: Who want to provide their teaching staff with high-quality, pre-configured AI teaching tools (Gemini Gems).
- **Localized Education**: Ideal for boards like **Karnataka State**, **CBSE**, **ICSE**, and **IGCSE** where aligning with local cultural context is critical.

## What does it help with?

TeacherAssist bridges the gap between abstract textbook definitions and the child's daily reality. It helps by:

- **Simplifying Explanations**: Converts complex topics into short, simple sentences and everyday analogies (e.g., using rice, chapati, or a school bus to explain science/math).
- **Universal Grade-Level Gems**: One single tool per grade that can handle any subject (Math, Science, Social Studies) with subject-specific pedagogical "flavors."
- **Interactive Commands**: Teachers can guide the AI using simple slash commands:
    - `/101`: Very basic explanation for first-time learners.
    - `/examples`: 3–5 extra examples from Indian daily life.
    - `/activities`: Low-cost classroom games and physical movement.
    - `/quiz`: Context-aware 8-10 question quizzes with answer keys.
    - `/youtube`: Search strings for visual animations and demonstrations.
    - `/parent`: Creates a 3-line summary for a parent WhatsApp group to bridge the home-school gap.
    - `/image-prompt`: Generates a descriptive prompt for AI image generators to create custom diagrams.
    - `/draw`: Provides a step-by-step layout for the classroom blackboard.
    - `/remedial`: Simplifies explanations for students who are behind, focusing on prerequisites.
    - `/help`: Displays all available commands.
- **Safe Classroom Guardrails**: Strictly ensures no religious, political, or social bias, and maintains absolute age-appropriateness and inclusivity.
- **One-Click Sharing**: Allows teachers to easily share Grade-level tools via WhatsApp for instant access.

## Pedagogical Alignment (NEP 2020)

TeacherAssist is deeply aligned with the **NEP 2020 5+3+3+4 framework**. The AI doesn't just simplify language; it changes its "instructional DNA" based on the student's pedagogical tier:

### 🧱 Foundational Stage (Grades 1–2)
- **Focus**: Play-based, activity-based, and discovery-based learning.
- **DNA**: framed as **Discovery**. It avoids lecture-style explanations.
- **Examples**: Uses household items (spoons, bottles) and family interactions (chores, games) to explain concepts. Language is kept to 3-5 word sentences.

### 🧩 Preparatory Stage (Grades 3–5)
- **Focus**: Transition from play to formal but highly interactive learning.
- **DNA**: framed as **Conceptual Anchoring**. It introduces formal labels (e.g., "This is called a Life Cycle") but anchors them in market visits, school-bus rides, and local environment observations.
- **Language**: Simple grammar, 5-8 word sentences, clear conceptual labels.

### ⚙️ Middle Stage (Grades 6–8)
- **Focus**: Subject-oriented pedagogical and curricular style.
- **DNA**: framed as **Critical Thinking**. It introduces abstract concepts (Algebra, Human Systems) and forces the AI to show the *why* first. It supports NEP's vision of moving away from rote memorization.
- **Language**: Compound sentences, standard terminology accompanied by immediate simplified explanations.

### 🎓 Secondary Stage (Grades 9–10)
- **Focus**: Greater depth, critical thinking, and preparation for rigorous study.
- **DNA**: framed as **Academic Rigor**. It uses standard academic English and focuses on logical reasoning, global civic responsibility, and complex systems (Genetics, Periodic Table, Laws of Motion).

## Board-Specific Intelligence

Every prompt is uniquely "flavored" to match the curriculum standards and cultural lens of the selected board:

- **Karnataka State Board**: 
  - *Lens*: **Regional Relevance**. 
  - *Context*: Prioritizes local landmarks, festivals, regional crops (Ragi, Coconut), and state-prescribed textbook structures. It ensures students feel the curriculum belongs to their world.
- **CBSE (Central Board)**: 
  - *Lens*: **Structured Conceptual Clarity**. 
  - *Context*: Aligns strictly with NCERT pedagogical flows. It ensures consistency across national standards and prepares students for competitive conceptual clarity.
- **ICSE (Council for ISCE)**: 
  - *Lens*: **Depth & Application**. 
  - *Context*: Known for extensive syllabi, the prompt pushes the AI toward high detailed depth and linguistic proficiency. It asks for "real-world application" in every single conceptual explanation.
- **IGCSE (International)**: 
  - *Lens*: **Global Inquiry**. 
  - *Context*: Uses international examples and pushes an "Inquiry Cycle" (Guess, Observe, Test, Conclude). It builds a global scientific mindset alongside local relatable examples.

## How it Works

1. **Admin Panel**: Administrators generate a "Universal Prompt" for a specific Grade and Board.
2. **Gemini Integration**: The prompt is used to create a "Gem" in Google Gemini, where grade-specific textbooks are uploaded as knowledge.
3. **Teacher Portal**: Teachers visit the portal, select their Grade, and instantly launch their custom AI assistant.
