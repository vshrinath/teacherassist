# TeacherAssist

TeacherAssist is a powerful, yet ultra-simple AI tool designed to help teachers explain complex concepts to students in Grade 1-10. It is specifically built for teachers working in resource-constrained environments where students may be developing English fluency and respond best to concrete, local, and relatable examples.

## Who is it for?

- **Teachers**: Especially those teaching Math, Science, Social Studies, and EVS in Grade 1-10.
- **School Administrators**: Who want to provide their teaching staff with high-quality, pre-configured AI teaching tools (Gemini Gems).
- **Localized Education**: Ideal for boards like **Karnataka State**, **CBSE**, **ICSE**, and **IGCSE** where aligning with local cultural context is critical.

## What does it help with?

TeacherAssist bridges the gap between abstract textbook definitions and the child's daily reality. It helps by:

- **Simplifying Explanations**: Converts complex topics into short, simple sentences and everyday analogies (e.g., using rice, chapati, or a school bus to explain science/math).
- **Universal Grade-Level Gems**: One single tool per grade that can handle any subject (Math, Science, Social Studies) with subject-specific pedagogical "flavors."
- **Interactive Commands**: Teachers can guide the AI using simple slash commands:
    - `/101`: Very basic explanation for first-time learners.
    - `/examples`: 3–5 extra examples from Indian daily life.
    - `/activities`: Low-cost classroom games and physical movement.
    - `/quiz`: Context-aware 8-10 question quizzes with answer keys.
    - `/youtube`: Search strings for visual animations and demonstrations.
    - `/step-by-step`: Breaks concepts into small steps across periods.
    - `/practice`: Simple oral or written practice questions.
    - `/story`: Relatable stories to explain complex ideas.
    - `/classroom`: Blackboard-based explanation strategies.
    - `/mistakes`: Common student misconceptions and how to correct them.
    - `/help`: Displays all available commands.
- **Safe Classroom Guardrails**: Strictly ensures no religious, political, or social bias, and maintains absolute age-appropriateness and inclusivity.
- **One-Click Sharing**: Allows teachers to easily share Grade-level tools via WhatsApp for instant access.

## Pedagogical Alignment (NEP 2020)

TeacherAssist is built on the **NEP 2020 5+3+3+4 framework**. The AI automatically adjusts its teaching DNA based on the student's developmental stage:

- **Foundational (Grade 1-2)**: Discovery-based learning using household items and short 3-word sentences.
- **Preparatory (Grade 3-5)**: Interactive learning with conceptual labels and local environment anchors.
- **Middle (Grade 6-8)**: Introduction of abstract concepts with a focus on critical thinking and "the why."
- **Secondary (Grade 9-10)**: Academic rigor, technical vocabulary, and global civic responsibility.

## Board-Specific Intelligence

Every prompt is uniquely "flavored" to match the curriculum and cultural lens of the selected board:

- **Karnataka State**: Focuses on regional relevance, local districts, and state-prescribed textbooks.
- **CBSE**: National standards and NCERT alignment with a focus on structured conceptual clarity.
- **ICSE**: High linguistic standards and deep, application-based learning for a detailed syllabus.
- **IGCSE**: Inquiry-led, global perspective using international examples and inquiry cycles.

## How it Works

1. **Admin Panel**: Administrators generate a "Universal Prompt" for a specific Grade and Board.
2. **Gemini Integration**: The prompt is used to create a "Gem" in Google Gemini, where grade-specific textbooks are uploaded as knowledge.
3. **Teacher Portal**: Teachers visit the portal, select their Grade, and instantly launch their custom AI assistant.
