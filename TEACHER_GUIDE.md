# TeacherAssist: Comprehensive Teacher Guide & FAQ

Welcome to TeacherAssist! This guide is designed to help you master your new AI-powered teaching assistant. We’ve removed the complexity of "prompt engineering" so you can focus on what matters most: teaching.

## 1. Getting Started: Your Teaching Workflow

**How do I start using a Gem?**
Find your Board and Grade on the dashboard and click **"Open Gem"**. This will open your specialized teaching assistant in a new window.
*   **Pro-Tip**: Once the Gem opens in Gemini, **Bookmark the page** in your browser. This gives you one-click access to your grade-level assistant every morning!

**How should I manage my lessons?**
*   **New Topic? Start Fresh**: For every new chapter or concept (e.g., "Photosynthesis"), always click **"New Chat"** in the Gemini sidebar. This ensures the AI stays focused on your current lesson and prevents confusion.
*   **Going Back**: To see notes or quizzes from yesterday, just find that specific chat in your Gemini history sidebar and continue typing.

## 2. The Slash Command Masterclass
*Each command is a pre-engineered instruction set—just type `/` followed by the command inside your Gem.*

### [/101] The "Ground Zero" Explanation
*   **When to use**: At the very start of a brand new, difficult topic.
*   **What it does**: Strips away technical jargon and uses simple English to explain the "why" and "how" using basic logic. Perfect for first-time exposure.

### [/quiz] Assessment & Live Class Interaction
*   **When to use**: To quickly check if students understood your lesson.
*   **What it does**: Generates 8-10 Multiple Choice or Fill-in-the-blank questions with an answer key.
*   **Power Usage**: You can refine the quiz live! Try typing: `/quiz make it story-led` or `/quiz use names from our local village`.
*   **Classroom Tip**: Project the Gem output or use your phone to run the quiz live with the whole class.

### [/draw] The Blackboard Planning Assistant
*   **When to use**: During your lesson preparation.
*   **What it does**: Provides a text-based layout for your physical blackboard. It tells you exactly where to write the "Main Goal," what keywords to put in the sidebars, and what simple diagrams to draw in the center.

### [/youtube] Visual Learning Search
*   **When to use**: When you need a video to demonstrate a concept.
*   **What it does**: Suggests the exact search terms you should use on YouTube (e.g., "Photosynthesis animation for Grade 4") to get high-quality, relevant results.

### [/remedial] The Empathy-First Catch-up Mode
*   **When to use**: For students who have missed fundamental concepts from earlier grades.
*   **What it does**: It "rewinds" to explain necessary prerequisites. If you are teaching Multiplication, it will first explain Repeated Addition using very concrete, familiar objects.

### [/parent] The Home-School Connection
*   **When to use**: To keep parents informed via WhatsApp.
*   **What it does**: Creates a beautiful 3-line update: what was learned, one fun fact, and one simple activity parents can do at home with household items.

### [/activities] Learning by Doing
*   **When to use**: To make concepts interesting through movement or games.
*   **What it does**: Suggests low-cost classroom games using pens, benches, or notebooks.

### [/examples] Extra Daily Life Context
*   **When to use**: When students need more real-world connections.
*   **What it does**: Gives 3-5 additional examples strictly from Indian daily life context.

### [/step-by-step] Lesson Planning
*   **What it does**: Breaks large concepts into small, digestible steps that you can teach across multiple school periods.

### [/practice] Targeted Questioning
*   **What it does**: Creates simple oral or written practice questions to reinforce core logic without any "trick" elements.

### [/story] Narrative Learning
*   **What it does**: Explais abstract ideas through relatable, Indian-setting stories.

### [/classroom] The "Chalk-and-Talk" Guide
*   **What it does**: Shows how a teacher can explain the concept using only the blackboard and verbal storytelling.

### [/mistakes] Misconception Alerts
*   **What it does**: Lists common mistakes children make with this topic and gives you gentle ways to correct them without shaming the student.

### [/image-prompt] AI Diagram Designer
*   **What it does**: Creates a detailed prompt you can paste into an AI Image Generator (like DALL-E) to create a custom, simplified educational diagram for your class.

## 3. Safety & Relatability Guardrails
*We have built rigorous, multi-layered instructions into every Gem to ensure it is always a safe and relatable space.*

**Indian Names & Situations**
The Gem is instructed to use a diverse range of Indian names (Arjun, Fatima, Mary, Deepa, etc.) and anchor every example in an Indian social context. Whether it's a trip to a local market or a story about a farm, the situations are those your students see every day.

**Zero-Bias Protocol**
Our engine is strictly forbidden from discussing religion, politics, or social hierarchies. It maintains a 100% neutral and inclusive ground at all times.

**The "Non-Elite" Promise**
We prioritize everyday materials like "stones and rice" over "expensive gadgets," ensuring no child feels excluded due to their background.

## 4. How This Was Built
**Simplified Prompt Engineering**
We use Google's advanced AI, but we have already done the hard work of "Prompt Engineering" for you. Each Gem is "System Prompted" with a massive set of instructional rules. You get the expert logic of an NEP 2020 pedagogical specialist without ever needing to learn how to talk to an AI.
