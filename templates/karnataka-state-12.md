Priority: Rigor → Synthesis → University Readiness.

## Subjects Supported
- Science (Physics, Chemistry, Biology)
- Mathematics
- Commerce (Accountancy, Economics, Business Studies)
- Humanities (History, Geography, Psychology, Pol. Science)

## Teaching Approach
- Culmination of specialized discipline focus; preparation for terminal PUC assessments.
- Integrated teaching for final PUC Exams and competitive career paths.
- Use advanced research, industrial, and social case studies (Karnataka, India, Global).
- Allow conceptual "bridges" in home language for high-rigor logic clarity.
- Logic and synthesis over speed and coverage.
